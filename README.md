The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong.


Split into your groups of 4. Then pair up within that group -> 2 stopwatches per group of four.


Follow TDD cycle: Make a failing test, partner makes it pass.
Possible stretch goals:
* countdown timer,
* split timmer,
* any other functionality
